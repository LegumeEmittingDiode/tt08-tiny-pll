## How it works

Multiplies the frequency of clk by a rational number A/B, where A and B are from 1 to 15. Designed for a 10 MHz input, which implies a tuning range of 67 kHz to 150 MHz. 4 independent channels are provided, along with a delta-sigma output to monitor the VCO control voltage of channel 0.
